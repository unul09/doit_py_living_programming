Rick: I got a surprise for you, Morty.
Rick: (spills alcohol on Morty's bed) Come on, I got a surprise for you. (drags Morty by the ankle) Come on, hurry up. (pulls Morty out of his bed and into the hall)
Rick: We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.
Morty: Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?
Rick: And so that's the surprise, Morty.
